            <h1>Security Considerations</h1>
            <p>Securing applications that are accessible to the Internet is not a trivial task. This page outlines some
            of the issues, and offers tips to help you secure your application using the Embedthis Appweb
            product.</p><a id="updates"></a>
            <h2 class="section">Updates</h2>
            <p>Even the best application or HTTP server can experience some security vulnerabilities that are
            discovered after being deployed in the field. It is highly recommended that you stay up to date with the
            latest version of Appweb.</p>
            <p><a href="http://www.embedthis.com/">Embedthis</a> provides security protection 
            as part of the Appweb commercial license that will proactively notify you of any security flaws
            and will expedite fixes or workarounds to minimize the vulnerability.</p>
            
            <a id="sandBoxing"></a>
            <h2 class="section">Sandboxing</h2>
            <p>Sandboxing is the term applied to running Appweb in a confined environment. When embedding a HTTP server,
            the profile of client access is often well known, and the profile of malicious attacks are well outside this
            profile. The profile includes the rate of accesses, the length of URLs and the size of pages returned to the
            user.</p>
            <p>Appweb has a set of configuration file directives that allow you to define a sandbox which specifies how
            Appweb must be used for a request to be serviced. By using well defined sandbox directives, you can help
            ensure that your application will not be compromised by malicious requests. You should customize the
            sandbox limits to use minimum values and thus provide the most protection.</p>
            <h3>Security Limit Directives</h3>
            <p>The Appweb security limits can be used to effectively block some denial of service attacks. 
            Setting the LimitRequestsPerClient to a low value can restrict the ability of a malicious client to monopolize
            the server. One attack method for denial of service attacks is to initiate requests, but not conclude the
            request headers. The server is then forced to wait for the client to complete the request before it can
            act. However, setting the RequestParseTimeout directive to a low value will abort such requests and prevent
            such attacks.</p>
            <p>The important security limit directives are:</p>
            <table title="sandbox">
                <tbody>
                    <tr>

                        <td>Maximum request and connection inactivity duration. This can be defined per route, so if you
                            have a long running request, create a dedicated route for that request.</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td class="pivot">LimitClients</td>

                        <td>Maximum duration to parse the request headers. This should be set very short. 
                            Typically a browser will send all the request headers in one network packet. Recommended
                            value is 5 secs.</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td class="pivot">RequestTimeout</td>
                        <td>Maximum request duration. Set this to the maximum time a request can take. This can
                            be defined per route, so if you have a long running request, create a dedicated
                            route and RequestTimeout for it.</td>

            </table>
            <p>See the <a href="dir/sandbox.html">Sandbox Directives</a> for further details.</p>
            <a id="account"></a>
            <h2 class="section">Appweb User Account</h2>
            <p>It is important that you run Appweb with the lowest system privilege that will get the job done. If any
            application is compromised, including Appweb, then the system will be safest if the compromised application
            has as few privileges as possible.</p>
            <h3>Unix Account</h3>
            <p>On Unix, Appweb initially runs as root or administrator and then changes to the user account defined in
            the Appweb configuration file via the <a href="dir/server.html#user">User</a> directive. As installed,
            Appweb will be configured to run in the <b>nobody</b> account on Unix. You may modify the user and group
            account for Appweb by changing the Appweb <a href="configuration.html">configuration file</a>.</p>
            <h3>Windows Account</h3>
            <p>On Windows, when running as a system service, Appweb will run using the LocalSystem account. This account
            has no privileges to access the network using network drives, named pipes, RPC or DCOM. However, it has
            considerable privileges locally. It is suggested that you create a dedicated account for Appweb to minimize
            the privileges available should Appweb be compromised.</p>
            <p>When creating an account for Appweb, ensure you do the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Using the Group Policy manager, grant the account the privilege of "Act as part of the operating
                system" and "Log on as a service".</li>
                <li>Ensure the account is a member of the "Users" group.</li>
                <li>Give the account read and execute rights to all HTML documents.</li>
                <li>Give the account read, write, execute and delete rights to the logs directory.</li>
                <li>Give the account read and execute rights to the appweb.exe and the DLLs in the libs directory.</li>
            </ul><a id="directoryPermissions"></a>
            <h2 class="section">Directory and File Permissions</h2>
            <p>When Appweb is installed, it is configured for maximum security. This section explains the policy 
            should you need to move or modify files and directories.</p>
            <p>To enhance security you need to consider the directory and file permissions for three classes of
            content:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Pages served by the HTTP server</li>
                <li>Scripts run by the HTTP server</li>
                <li>Configuration and log files used by the HTTP server.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Pages served by the Appweb server should be owned by root or administrator and should be only readable
            by the Appweb user account. Directories containing served pages should be readable and executable only.</p>
            <p>Scripts run by the Appweb server should always be outside all directories containing served pages. After
            all, you don't want prying eyes viewing your scripts! Scripts should be owned by the <b>root</b> or
            <b>administrator</b> and should only be readable and executable by the Appweb user account.</p>
            <p>Configuration and log files used by the Appweb server should always be outside all directories
            containing served pages or scripts. The directory containing the log files must be writable by the Appweb
            user account.</p>
            <h3>Home Directory Permissions</h3>
            <p>The root directory for Appweb is called the Home directory and is defined by the Home
            directive in the configuration file. The Home directory, and the logs and lib directory below it,
            should be owned by <b>root</b> (or admin), and should be in the group <b>root</b> (or administrators). They
            should only be writable by this specific user and group.</p>
            <p>For Linux, these commands will ensure the privileges are correctly set up:</p>
            <pre>
cd    /etc/appweb
chown root . lib logs
chgrp root . lib logs
chmod 755  . lib logs
</pre>
            <a id="dynamicContent"></a>
            <h2 class="section">Dynamic Content</h2>
            <p>Appweb supports several Web Frameworks for creating dynamic content. These frameworks sometimes require
            special security considerations because they are executing code or scripts to render the content.</p>
            <h3>Ejscript Web Framework</h3>
            <p>Appweb supports the Ejscript web framework for dynamic web applications. Ejscript will execute HTML
            pages with embedded script code and process the pages before returning the result to the client. Properly
            configured, your scripts will not be readable by users and they will only see the generated content.</p>
            <p>To keep server-side scripts private, you must have the Ejscript handler configured to process the
            required script extensions or URL prefixes. If a script extension is not configured, the <b>file</b>
            handler may process the page and return the raw script back to the user. As installed, Appweb defines the
            ".ejs" extension for Ejscript pages. Using the <a href="dir/ejs.html#ejsAppAlias">EjsAppAlias</a> directive
            will correctly configure an Ejscript application to prevent access to raw script code.</p>
            <h3>PHP</h3>
            <p>The php.ini file controls the setup and execution of the PHP web framework. The following table lists
            several parameters that should be set for enhanced security:</p>
            <table title="parameters">
                <thead>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Parameter</th>
                        <th>Description</th>
                    </tr>
                </thead>
                <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <td>safe_mode = on</td>
                        <td>When safe mode is enabled, PHP scripts can only access a file if it is the owner of the
                        file. This prevents access to system files.</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>safe_mode = on</td>
                        <td>When safe mode is enabled, PHP scripts can only access a file if it is the same group as
                        the file. This prevents access to system files.</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>open_basedir = directory[:...]</td>
                        <td>Define a set of directories that will be the only directories for files that PHP can
                        access.</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td class="nowrap">safe_mode_exec_dir = directory[:...]</td>
                        <td>Define a set of directories that will be the only directories from which PHP can execute

            <h3>Changing the extension</h3>
            <p>To obscure the fact that PHP is being run on the server-side, you can change the extension for pages
            from <b>.php</b> to say ".web". You then need to add the following directive to the appweb.conf file.</p>
            <pre>
AddType application/x-httpd-php .web
</pre>
            <h2 class="section">Embedded Server Pages</h2>
            <p>ESP applications are not immune to security flaws. It is highly recommended that
            you use the <a href="../../../api/mpr.html">MPR</a> services for all your ESP code. This portable runtime
            has been extensively tested and includes routines to guard against common buffer overflows and other such
            exploits.</p>
            <a id="ssl"></a>
            <h2 class="section">SSL Servers</h2>
            <p>If you configure a SSL virtual server, remember to define a separate Documents directory if you want to only
            serve private content to SSL users. Otherwise those pages will also be visible via the default
            server.</p><a id="authentication"></a>
            <h2 class="section">Authentication</h2>
            <p>It is highly recommended that you use only <a href="authentication.html#digestAuthentication">Digest</a>
            authentication and not Basic authentication. As implemented in Appweb, digest authentication provides many
            safeguards against known exploits including; man-in-the-middle attacks, client spoofing, and replay
            attacks.</p>
            
            
            <a id="logFiles"></a>
            <h2 class="section">Log Files</h2>
            <p>Appweb will log satisfied requests to the access log (usually logs/access.log) and errors to the error
            log (usually logs/error.log). It is recommended that you regularly review these logs for suspicious
            activity.</p>
